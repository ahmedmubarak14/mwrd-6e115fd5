# ðŸ§ª BUSINESS LOGIC TESTING PLAN

## Critical Workflow Testing

### 1. RFQ CREATION & MANAGEMENT FLOW

#### Test Scenario 1: Complete RFQ Lifecycle
**Steps:**
1. Client creates RFQ with all required fields
2. System validates and saves RFQ to database
3. RFQ appears in vendor browsing interface
4. Vendors can view RFQ details and submit bids
5. Client receives notifications about new bids
6. Client can compare and evaluate bids
7. Client accepts/rejects bids
8. System creates orders from accepted bids

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… RFQ created successfully with proper validation
- âœ… Database triggers fire correctly for notifications
- âœ… Vendor interface shows available RFQs
- âœ… Bid submission workflow works end-to-end
- âœ… Order creation automatic from accepted bids

#### Test Scenario 2: RFQ Validation & Edge Cases
**Steps:**
1. Test required field validation
2. Test budget range validation (min < max)
3. Test deadline validation (future dates only)
4. Test file upload limits and formats
5. Test category selection validation
6. Test Arabic RTL form behavior

### 2. OFFER/BID SUBMISSION FLOW

#### Test Scenario 3: Vendor Offer Submission
**Steps:**
1. Vendor browses available requests
2. Vendor clicks "Submit Offer"
3. Vendor fills offer form with pricing/timeline
4. Vendor uploads supporting documents
5. System validates and saves offer
6. Client receives notification
7. Offer appears in client's offer review interface

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Offer form validation works correctly
- âœ… File uploads are secure and accessible
- âœ… Database relationships are properly maintained
- âœ… Notifications trigger correctly
- âœ… Status tracking works throughout lifecycle

### 3. ORDER CREATION & MANAGEMENT FLOW

#### Test Scenario 4: Order Lifecycle Management
**Steps:**
1. Client accepts vendor offer
2. System automatically creates order record
3. Order appears in both client and vendor dashboards
4. Status updates propagate correctly
5. Financial transaction records are created
6. Communication channels are established
7. Order completion workflow functions

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Orders created automatically from accepted offers
- âœ… Status tracking accurate across all interfaces
- âœ… Financial records maintained properly
- âœ… Communication system works for order-related messages

### 4. USER VERIFICATION & SECURITY FLOW

#### Test Scenario 5: User Verification Process
**Steps:**
1. New user registers and uploads documents
2. Admin receives verification request
3. Admin reviews and approves/rejects
4. User receives notification of decision
5. User permissions updated based on verification status
6. Access controls enforced correctly

### 5. NOTIFICATION & COMMUNICATION SYSTEM

#### Test Scenario 6: Real-time Communication
**Steps:**
1. Test in-app notification delivery
2. Test email notification system  
3. Test real-time message delivery
4. Test notification preferences
5. Test bulk communication from admin

### 6. ANALYTICS & REPORTING ACCURACY

#### Test Scenario 7: Data Accuracy Verification
**Steps:**
1. Create test transactions across all user types
2. Verify dashboard statistics accuracy
3. Test export functionality
4. Verify financial reporting accuracy
5. Test performance metrics calculation
